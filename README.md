## The project
Having a solid portfolio as a developer is akin to having a good RBI as a pro baseball player. Hence, why this project is a vital task to not only create but to grow and maintain along the way. I felt as though I used a lot of original code in this project. I feel mostly confident in the skills i learned and have utilized so far and I know that my skills can grow tremendously the more I practice. This is a good example of my skills thus far and I'm excited to see the changes I could possibly execute in the future.
